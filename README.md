1.8.9 mcpvp resource pack managed with git for better collaboration

made by Lemonnix and music_cat3!!

you can download the pack via Code -> Download Zip - this will give you a zip that you *have* to extract - the resulting folder will be the one that you can use in Minecraft. I cannot stress this enough.
